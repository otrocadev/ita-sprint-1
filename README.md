![SASS aproach](assets/img/screenshoot-sass.png)

This first sprint aims to create a simple landing page using three diferent aproaches:
- Vanilla (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
- Implementing SASS instead of vanilla CSS
- Implementing Tailwind instead of vanilla CSS

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this first aproach is to continue developing the web project while implementing a CSS postprocesser. It is not intended to have a perfect final product, as the goal is to slowly iterate the web adding more parts of it as we change technologies, as we did on the **[#vanilla](https://github.com/otrocadev/ita-sprint-1/tree/vanilla)** or will see on the **[#tailwind](https://github.com/otrocadev/ita-sprint-1/tree/dev)** branches respectively.
