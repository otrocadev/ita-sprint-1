![Vanilla aproach](assets/img/screenshoot-vanilla.png)

This first sprint aims to create a simple landing page using three diferent aproaches:
- Vanilla (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
- Implementing SASS instead of vanilla CSS
- Implementing Tailwind instead of vanilla CSS

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this first aproach is to create a base HTML structure for the page proposed on the course, applying only vanilla technologies. It is not intended to have a perfect final product, as the goal is to slowly iterate the web adding more parts of it as we change technologies, as we will see on the **[#sass](https://github.com/otrocadev/ita-sprint-1/tree/sass)** or the **[#tailwind](https://github.com/otrocadev/ita-sprint-1/tree/dev)** branches respectively.

## 🛠️ Stack

As this is the Branch for the vanilla project, the stack is the **navtive triology**:

- 📝 Native HTML

- 💚 Native JavaScript
