## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this last aproach is to finish the visual part of the the web project we have been developing, while implementing the [**Tailwind CSS library**](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is not intended to be a perfect final product, as the goal is to learn web development, iterating the changing technologies, as we did on the **[#vanilla](https://github.com/otrocadev/ita-sprint-1/tree/vanilla)** or the **[#sass](https://github.com/otrocadev/ita-sprint-1/tree/sass)** branches respectively.
